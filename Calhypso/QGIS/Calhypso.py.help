{"Basin_shapefile": "Polygon shapefile with the drainage basins", "ALG_DESC": "This script calculates and shows hypsometric curves for selected drainage basins. The output graphic window is interactive and accepts the following key commands: \n\nA - Shows all the profiles in a single graphic \n\nUP - HI color mode. Curves will be colored by their HI value according the color ramp. \n\nDOWN - Order color mode. Curves will be colored by their order. \n\nC - Change the color ramp. There are 8 different diverging color ramps available. \n\nD - Shows / Hide legend in the graphic with all the curves \n\nLEFT - RIGHT - Changes the graphic window to represent single curves and moves to the previous / next one. \n\nM - Shows / hides alternative hypsometric metrics (Kurtosis, Skewness, Density Kurtosis, and Density Skewness) in individual curve plots. See Harlin 1978 for description. \n\nX - Save all the profiles in a specific format in the same directory as the basin shapefile. Format has to be selected with keys 1-3. It would be generated a single graphic per curve. If alternative metrics are on, they would be printed. \n1-3 - Keys to select formats (only active if X is press first) \n\nE - Export all curves in text files in the same directory as the basin shapefile. Each file will have 2 columns corresponding to a/H and h/H values. File names will be taken from curve names. It also generated a file named \"curve_moments.txt\" with all the hypsometric metrics values. \n==================================================================== \nThis script is a QGIS adaption of the code presented in P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al. 2009.
